as we reflect on this Thanksgiving, Corey and I are thrilled to share that 
we successfully embarked on a 20-minute trip
  to our friends' house for Friendsgiving, marking the first outing in our beloved 1984 
  Fleetwood Southwind.


  <br><br>
<img style="width:100%" src="//live.staticflickr.com/65535/53355854666_9de8b09cb9_k.jpg">
  <br><br>

while our feline companions stayed comfortably at home, the RV and we were warmly 
welcomed by everyone at our friends' gathering. It was a joyous occasion, filled with 
laughter, gratitude, and the realization that our dream of making the RV a functional 
living space was becoming a reality. Kelly made delicious foods of all thankful varieties
and we all had a great night.


<br><br>
<img style="width:100%" src="//live.staticflickr.com/65535/53356078133_681e747205_k.jpg">

<br><br>
following the festivities, Corey and I decided to finally give in to the urge in the backs
of our minds since we first bought the RV and spent our first 
night in the RV on Thanksgiving! The experience was both exciting and cozy, setting the 
stage for the next phase of our adventure.



<br><br>
<img style="width:100%" src="//live.staticflickr.com/65535/53356184879_c2d72d16ce_k.jpg">
<br><Br>

upon happily returning home, we took the time to share some love with our cats before 
diving into the process of seriously moving into the RV. With the power connected, our 
mobile abode had become livable enough for us to comfortably spend time in!


<br><br>
<img style="width:24.5%" src="//live.staticflickr.com/65535/53354979977_85c60a1775_k.jpg">
<img style="width:74.5%" src="//live.staticflickr.com/65535/53354981217_857ec2cd27_k.jpg">
<br><br>

the cats joined us for the night, and their quick adaptation surprised us. They became 
so at-home in the RV that we've decided not to take them back inside the house. This 
development signaled a major shift in our living arrangements â€“ we are now primarily 
living in the RV!


<br><br>
<img style="width:100%" src="//live.staticflickr.com/65535/53356184959_87fbf5ebe4_k.jpg">
<br><br>

while our new lifestyle is exhilarating, we acknowledge the tasks ahead. Downsizing, 
selling items, and engaging in a real-life game of Tetris as we organize our belongings 
and storage spaces are on the agenda. The excitement is palpable, and we can't wait 
to fully embrace this minimalist way of living.
<br> <br>
the RV drove beautifully on the way to our Friendsgiving, and, excepting an interesting
sound while idling that makes me wonder about the fuel delivery system / vacuum or perhaps 
spark plugs / firing order. That remains to be seen, but, at this point, it's not an 
issue that is worrying us about getting around.



<br><br>
<img style="width:100%" src="//live.staticflickr.com/65535/53356184874_bea6c26d39_k.jpg">
<br><br>


to enhance our RV-living know-how, we plan to travel a bit further south to stay with 
my good friend Mari, who is already well-versed in RV living. Her insights will 
undoubtedly help us fine-tune the RV setup.

<br><br>
<img style="width:100%" src="//live.staticflickr.com/65535/53354981162_6be27d93fb_k.jpg">
<br><br>
one remarkable aspect of this transition is how seamlessly our cats have settled in. 
They are all happy and cozy, each finding their favorite spots within our mobile home. 
As we continue this journey, we are filled with gratitude for the support and the sense 
of home that the RV is rapidly becoming. Stay tuned for more updates as we navigate 
the road to full-time RV living.

        <data-content> 

before I even stepped out to face the challenges awaiting our 
          1984 Fleetwood Southwind this morning, Romeow, our 
          eldest, most tail-less, cyclops-est feline family member, 
          leaped onto my shoulders, purring 
          and meowing happy trillsâ€”a lovely serenade to accompany 
          our ongoing RV restoration journey. Little did I know 
          that the day would unfold as a testament to resilience, 
          perseverance, and the uplifting presence of our floofy Captain.
<br /><br />
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/199627824@N08/53351203250/in/dateposted-public/" title="Romeow"><img style="width:100%" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/31337/53351203250_0deffd1841_k.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Romeow"/></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
          
 <br /><br />          
with Corey's magic touch, the oil change went smoothly, and our 
          Southwind roared to life. However, the triumph was short-lived. 
          The replacement of the AC belt brought an unexpected 
          roadblockâ€”our beloved RV refused to start. Determined to 
          unravel the mystery, we delved into the complexities beneath
          the hood.
<br /><br />
<img style="width:100%" src="//live.staticflickr.com/65535/53351173200_c3bfc84dec_b.jpg">
<br /><br />
we tore apart the ignition, learned 3 hot-wiring techniques, 
          examined solenoids (yes, there are two), and considered the 
          starter. The jumble of wires underneath and sticking out of everything seemed to mock 
          our attempts to make sense of it all. It was a challenging, 
          almost disheartening, puzzle.
<br /><br />
<img style="width:100%" src="//live.staticflickr.com/65535/53349851272_1e9eacd553_b.jpg">
 <br /><br />         
amidst the mechanical conundrum, and whilst Pluto and Phoinix cuddled up 
          safe and warm inside the apartment,
          Tony, a dear old friend with a knack for 
          problem-solving, arrived in the rain to lend a hand. It was 
          a humbling moment when the solution revealed itselfâ€”a loose 
          wing nut connected to the battery terminal. With a simple 
          twist, our Southwind roared back to life.
<br /><br />

          
but the day held more surprises. Romeow's joyful serenade continued as 
          he witnessed the entire ordeal from his perch. His raspy meow 
          and lively spirit kept a light energy to the air.  He was our 
          cheerleader and sage. As we tightened that crucial connection, 
          not only did our RV spring back to life, but a disconnected 
          switch for the heater blower was rediscovered, and our dormant 
          fridge and freezer also came back to life.
<br /><br />
<img style="width:100%" src="//live.staticflickr.com/65535/53350743301_30bf73cc6a_b.jpg">
<br /><br />          
in a single day filled with trials and triumphs, Romeow's cozy presence 
          became the theme to our success, our lucky little pirate kitty. Later, on our brief yet 
          victorious trip to the gas stationâ€”with Romeow, of course, 
          perched on his favored spotâ€”each turn we took felt like a victory 
          lap. As we continue our RV restoration saga, guided by Romeow's 
          spirited blessings, stay tuned for more updates on the twisted
          path of bringing our vintage road baby back to life.

          last night marked a significant milestone in our RV adventure as we <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/1310228453015941">successfully 
          brought our beloved 1984 Fleetwood Southwind back to life (click)</a>. The heart of the operation? 
          A torn alternator belt and a dose of fuel injector cleaner. With these simple fixes, 
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/1310228453015941">she roared to life, sounding even better than the day we first met her</a>.

our journey, however, is far from over. There's a checklist of tasks ahead, each contributing to
 the resurrection of our vintage road companion. First on the agenda is swapping out the loose AC belt 
 and giving her a well-deserved oil change. While I've never tackled an oil change before, Corey 
 assures me he's up to the task. An adventure in itself, I'm sure. (Don't worry, there will be video).
 Here's a diagram of the belt routing that I found useful. (not my image). We don't have a pulley on the 
 smog pump, as it is not in use.

<br><br>
<img style="width:40%" src="//live.staticflickr.com/65535/53341948178_52eb7cc6d4_z.jpg">
<br><br>

the next steps involve crucial maintenance â€“ sealing the roof, addressing water-damaged interior 
pieces, and identifying, insulating, and sealing any pesky air leaks. The masters of the project, obviously the 
cats, seem to sense the excitement in the air and are eagerly anticipating the day when our home 
on wheels is fully operational. Romeow has developed a new habit: asking to hang out with us in the RV when we get up in the mornings.


<br><br>
<img style="width:100%" src="//live.staticflickr.com/65535/53341728436_b259391a4f_z.jpg">
 <br><br>
looking ahead, the spotlight will be shining on the interior, where the magic happens. We'll be channeling 
our inner DIY enthusiasts to create a functional and cozy space, with special attention given to 
the kitchen and bathroom areas, as well as some cute DIY ideas to add enrichment for the vibrating creatures. It's a blank canvas awaiting our personal touch, and the prospect 
of transforming our RV into a home is both exhilarating and daunting.

memories, breathing new life into a vintage GEM, and embracing the freedom of the open road. 
Join us as we navigate the twists and turns of RV restoration, one belt, and one cat-approved 
renovation at a time.

          to take you on the journey of our lives. We recently became the proud
          owners of a 1984 Fleetwood Southwind RV, marking the beginning of our
          nomadic adventure across the gorgeous and expansive landscapes of the United States.
          Buckle up and join us as we traverse the country with our
          <a href="./media.html">furry companions (click)</a> â€“
          <a href="./media.html">Pluto, Romeow, and Phoinix</a> â€“ in tow.

          <br /><br />
          the idea of embarking on this epic road trip has been a dream of ours
          for a long time, and now, with the wheels of destiny, (and soon the RV,)
          in motion, we can't wait to share our experiences with you. Our
          escapades will unfold through social media platforms,
          including YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok, so you can virtually hop on
          board and be part of every twist and turn.

          but our journey isn't just about the (s)miles we'll cover; it's also
          about discovering the natural beauty and resources scattered across
          this diverse land. As we roam from state to state, we plan to harness
          the power of nature by extracting essential oils from the resources we
          encounter. These oils will then be transformed into unique fragrances,
          capturing the essence of each location we visit. From the crisp
          mountain air to the salty breeze of coastal towns, our fragrances will
          tell the story of our adventure, and they will be available in limited
          quantities for sale.

          currently, our days are filled with the hum of power tools and the
          frequent meow of our feline companions as we (admittedly scratch our
          heads a lot and) work on transforming our RV into a rolling haven. The
          first order of business? Replacing an alternator belt and addressing a
          few mechanical "quirks" to ensure our journey is as safe and smooth as
          possible. Once the mechanical aspects are fine-tuned, our focus will
          shift to the interior of the RV. Which.. We will get into later.. XD

          /><br /><br />
          our to-do list seems abundantly endless, but we're tackling each task with
          enthusiasm, gratitude, and a shared vision of creating a home on wheels that
          reflects both functionality and extreme coziness. From designing a
          space-efficient kitchen to crafting cozy nooks and climbable pieces
          for our cats, we're pouring our hearts into every detail. We can't
          wait to reveal the transformation and show you how a vintage RV can be
          reborn into a luxy and practical mobile home, and on the most budget-est of budgets.
          <br /><br />

          fully clad in rainbows and wrenches, creativity flowing like the leaks we still need to fix, we invite you to
          follow along as we document the highs, the lows, and everything in
          between. Whether you're a seasoned traveler, a cat lover, a DIY
          enthusiast, fragrance lover, or simply seeking a vicarious escape, we hope our journey
          resonates with you.
