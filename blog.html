          last night marked a significant milestone in our RV adventure as we <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/1310228453015941">successfully 
          brought our beloved 1984 Fleetwood Southwind back to life (click)</a>. The heart of the operation? 
          A torn alternator belt and a dose of fuel injector cleaner. With these simple fixes, 
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/1310228453015941">she roared to life, sounding even better than the day we first met her</a>.

our journey, however, is far from over. There's a checklist of tasks ahead, each contributing to
 the resurrection of our vintage road companion. First on the agenda is swapping out the loose AC belt 
 and giving her a well-deserved oil change. While I've never tackled an oil change before, Corey 
 assures me he's up to the task. An adventure in itself, I'm sure. (Don't worry, there will be video).
 Here's a diagram of the belt routing that I found useful. (not my image). We don't have a pulley on the 
 smog pump, as it is not in use.

<br><br>

the next steps involve crucial maintenance â€“ sealing the roof, addressing water-damaged interior 
pieces, and identifying, insulating, and sealing any pesky air leaks. The masters of the project, obviously the 
cats, seem to sense the excitement in the air and are eagerly anticipating the day when our home 
on wheels is fully operational. Romeow has developed a new habit: asking to hang out with us in the RV when we get up in the mornings.

looking ahead, the spotlight will be shining on the interior, where the magic happens. We'll be channeling 
our inner DIY enthusiasts to create a functional and cozy space, with special attention given to 
the kitchen and bathroom areas, as well as some cute DIY ideas to add enrichment for the vibrating creatures. It's a blank canvas awaiting our personal touch, and the prospect 
of transforming our RV into a home is both exhilarating and daunting.

this restoration journey is not just about fixing mechanical issues; it's about reclaiming 
memories, breathing new life into a vintage GEM, and embracing the freedom of the open road. 
Join us as we navigate the twists and turns of RV restoration, one belt, and one cat-approved 
renovation at a time.

          >hey there, fellow wanderers! We're Corey and Michael, and we're about
          to take you on the journey of our lives. We recently became the proud
          owners of a 1984 Fleetwood Southwind RV, marking the beginning of our
          nomadic adventure across the gorgeous and expansive landscapes of the United States.
          Buckle up and join us as we traverse the country with our
          <a href="./media.html">furry companions (click)</a> â€“
          <a href="./media.html">Pluto, Romeow, and Phoinix</a> â€“ in tow.

          the idea of embarking on this epic road trip has been a dream of ours
          for a long time, and now, with the wheels of destiny, (and soon the RV,)
          in motion, we can't wait to share our experiences with you. Our
          escapades will unfold through social media platforms,
          including YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok, so you can virtually hop on
          board and be part of every twist and turn.

          /><br /><br />
          but our journey isn't just about the (s)miles we'll cover; it's also
          about discovering the natural beauty and resources scattered across
          this diverse land. As we roam from state to state, we plan to harness
          the power of nature by extracting essential oils from the resources we
          encounter. These oils will then be transformed into unique fragrances,
          capturing the essence of each location we visit. From the crisp
          mountain air to the salty breeze of coastal towns, our fragrances will
          tell the story of our adventure, and they will be available in limited
          quantities for sale.

          currently, our days are filled with the hum of power tools and the
          frequent meow of our feline companions as we (admittedly scratch our
          heads a lot and) work on transforming our RV into a rolling haven. The
          first order of business? Replacing an alternator belt and addressing a
          few mechanical "quirks" to ensure our journey is as safe and smooth as
          possible. Once the mechanical aspects are fine-tuned, our focus will
          shift to the interior of the RV. Which.. We will get into later.. XD
          <br /><br />

          our to-do list seems abundantly endless, but we're tackling each task with
          enthusiasm, gratitude, and a shared vision of creating a home on wheels that
          reflects both functionality and extreme coziness. From designing a
          space-efficient kitchen to crafting cozy nooks and climbable pieces
          for our cats, we're pouring our hearts into every detail. We can't
          wait to reveal the transformation and show you how a vintage RV can be
          reborn into a luxy and practical mobile home, and on the most budget-est of budgets.
          <br /><br />

          fully clad in rainbows and wrenches, creativity flowing like the leaks we still need to fix, we invite you to
          follow along as we document the highs, the lows, and everything in
          between. Whether you're a seasoned traveler, a cat lover, a DIY
          enthusiast, fragrance lover, or simply seeking a vicarious escape, we hope our journey
          resonates with you.

          so join us as we roll down the scenic routes (at reduced speeds to accomodate our home-on-wheels), chasing sunsets and
          discovering the hidden gems of America, learning more about people, vehicles, culture, and ourselves along the way. Your front-row seat to our
          nomadic life awaits, and we can't wait to share it with you. Here's to
          the open road and the countless adventures that lie ahead!
